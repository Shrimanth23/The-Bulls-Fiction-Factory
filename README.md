# The-Bulls-Fiction-Factory

Drawing inspiration from the movies database through which we learnt Advanced Data Base Management, we developed a we application for creating and sharing fan fiction stories. I chose this project to showcase my skills in web development, database management and integrating various technologies. This project is built using key skills like MongoDB, HTML, SQL.
